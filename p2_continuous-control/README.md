# Project 2: Continuous Control

### Introduction

For this project, you will work with the [Reacher](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ml-agents/blob/master/docs/Learning-Environment-Examples.md#reacher) environment.

In this environment, a double-jointed arm can move to target locations. A reward of +0.1 is provided for each step that the agent's hand is in the goal location. Thus, the goal of your agent is to maintain its position at the target location for as many time steps as possible.

The observation space consists of 33 variables corresponding to position, rotation, velocity, and angular velocities of the arm. Each action is a vector with four numbers, corresponding to torque applicable to two joints. Every entry in the action vector should be a number between -1 and 1.

The environment is considered solved, when the average (over 100 episodes) of the average scores is at least +30. 


### Getting Started

1. Set up and use a DRLND conda python environment to run this project as described under Dependencies section at https://github.com/udacity/deep-reinforcement-learning

2. Clone https://github.com/shazimov/deep_reinforcement_learning.git

3. Download the environment from one of the links below.  You need only select the environment that matches your operating system:
